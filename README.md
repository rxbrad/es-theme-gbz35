# Gameboy Zero 3.5" Theme for EmulationStation (OpenDingux RG350 / RG280 Version)

*This is a stripped-down version of the GBZ35  theme, which is compatible with EmulationStation 2.0.0-RC1, which is commonly used on OpenDingux devices.*

This theme pulls heavily from the [Carbon](https://github.com/RetroPie/es-theme-carbon) (controller & system vector art), [Spare](https://github.com/mattrixk/es-theme-spare) (preliminary layout), and [SimpleBigArt](https://github.com/robertybob/es-theme-simplebigart) (preliminary background art) themes.  It is optimized for resolutions up to 640x480 on small 4:3 screens (like the 3.5" screen on the Anbernic RG-350).  It also works on 16:9 screens but you will notice that the background art is stretched when viewing in this aspect.

Changelog
-----------
